# Data-Capstone-Project

Call Capstone Project - For this capstone project we will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle. And finding the answers of some basics questions like What are the top 5 zipcodes for 911 calls , What are the top 5 townships (twp) for 911 calls ,Take a look at the 'title' column, how many unique title codes are there ,and then some typical questions like ,In the titles column there are "Reasons/Departments" specified before the title code. These are EMS, Fire, and Traffic. Use .apply() with a custom lambda expression to create a new column called "Reason" that contains this string value ,  What is the most common Reason for a 911 call based off of this new column , Now use seaborn to create a countplot of 911 calls by Reason. ,Now use seaborn to create a countplot of the Day of Week column with the hue based off of the Reason column. Now create a simple plot off of the dataframe indicating the count of calls per month.
